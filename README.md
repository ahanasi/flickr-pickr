# flickr-pickr

Project created as part of the [Odin on Rails curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/using-an-api).

This project was my first foray into working with an external API. The flickr-pickr app is a simple photo widget that can display photos from Flickr users' public photostream through the Flikr API. The app also lets you search for images using descriptive keyword tags.

Bulma was used as the CSS framework while the Fiagro gem was used to securely configure the Flickr API for the Rails application. The will-paginate gem was used for pagination.
